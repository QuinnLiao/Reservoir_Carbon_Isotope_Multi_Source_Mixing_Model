# C14 Isotope Analysis with simmr

# Overview

This R script performs C14 Isotope Analysis using the simmr package. It processes isotopic data from different water layers (photic, hypolimnion, and outflow), runs a Bayesian mixing model (simmr_mcmc), and saves the summary results to a CSV file.

# Dependencies

Ensure you have the following R package installed before running the script:

  install.packages("simmr")

Load the required library:

  library(simmr)

# Data Structure

The script analyzes C14 DIC (Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) isotope values from three different water layers:

**Photic Zone (C14DIC_photic)

  Hypolimnion (C14DIC_hypolimnion)

  Outflow (C14DIC_outflow)**

Each layer contains isotopic values used as input data for the Bayesian mixing model.

# Carbon Sources and Isotopic Values

The model uses predefined Î´13C values for different carbon sources:

**  source_data_photic: Carbon sources for the photic layer
  
  source_data_hypolimnion_outflow: Carbon sources for the hypolimnion and outflow layers**

The sources also have associated standard deviations (source_sds_photic, source_sds_hypolimnion_outflow).

# Execution Steps

1. Initialize data: The script defines isotopic values for different water layers.

2. Loop through each layer and isotope value:

    Load data into simmr_load().

    Run Bayesian MCMC model using simmr_mcmc().

    Extract results and save them to a CSV file.

3. Save results: The processed data is written to simmr_results_summary_test.csv.

# Output

The script generates a CSV file containing the summary results from the Bayesian analysis

Each row represents a different isotopic analysis with calculated Bayesian statistics.
